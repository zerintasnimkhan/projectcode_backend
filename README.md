# Chat server

It’s time to move to the back-end side of the force! The chat client you created needs to be paired with its server counterpart.

This project is divided in 3 steps, aim to complete one section per day. For each section use the respective folder in the `/server` directory, and save the required dependencies in the global `package.json`.

Finally, use [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), or the `--watch` flag in Node 19+, it will make your life much easier.

### Bare Node

Check out the difference between [blocking and non-blocking code](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/), and read the [anatomy of an HTTP transaction](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/). Then take a moment to get familiar with the Node JS docs. At first it looks more cryptic than other documentation you’ve seen before, but as always it’s just a matter of getting used to it. Here’s [an example](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback), make sure you can fully understand it before moving forward (if you get stuck ask for help).

- Following [this template](https://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html) create an `index.js` file that contains a basic Node server running on port `3000`. and responds `'Hello world'` to any request it receives.

- In the same file, create a basic router that serves static assets from the `/client` folder (for this you’ll need to use some regex combined with the [Node file system API](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)), and check that your client correctly loads in the browser.

- Create a simple data store on your server, which acts as a rudimentary database. This store will be replaced in the future with a real database but, for now, it can be an in-memory JS object (e.g. `const db = {msgs: []}`) that stores all your chat messages. Keep in mind that those messages will be erased every time the server is restarted.

- Your server should expose the following REST API (use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for testing):
  - `/message GET` - Get all the messages
  - `/message POST` - Post a message

  For the `POST` route to work you need to create a request [body parser](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body).

- Any request for a non-existing route should return a `404` HTTP code.

- Modularity is a key concept in Software Engineering. So, now take this monstrous complex file you have created, and divide it in 4 modules that are responsible for each part.

  - `index.js` - Server bootstrap
  - `body-parser.js` - Middleware that parses the body of POST requests
  - `router.js` - Contains all your routing code
  - `db.js` - Where you keep your storage logic

- Modify your client so that:
  - When it loads, it gets all messages from the server.
  - Each time a new message is written, it posts it to the server.

- Take a look at the `node.test.js` file to see an example of a unit test for the `/` endpoint, and complete the two tests that are missing for the `/messages` endpoint.

If all the above has been implemented correctly, you should now be able to reload the client (or open a new one in another browser tab) and see all the previous messages. Rejoice!

### Express

Would you like to be able to do all of this much faster? If so, you’re ready to meet your first back-end framework! Take a look at the [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/), and become familiar with the five components of its [API](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) (express, application, request, response, and router).

- Then recreate your server using Express (start from [this template](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)).
- After you’re done with the transition, refactor your architecture to follow an [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern. In this case you only need the “M” and “C” part (since your “V” is directly rendered in the client).
- Don’t forget to add unit tests in the `express.test.js` file.

### Koa

Directly from the creators of Express, meet its successor: Koa. Before diving into it, make sure you feel comfortable using different async code patterns by completing the [async-exercise](https://github.com/codeworks/async-patterns-exercise).

- Now, check out [the docs](http://koajs.com/), and compare where Koa differs from Express.
- Finally rebuild your server, taking advantage of the new APIs.
- Don’t forget to add unit tests in the `koa.test.js` file.

## Getting started

To install the required dependencies run `npm install`.

Now copy all the files you had in the `/app` folder of the `chat-client` repo into the `/client` folder of this repo.

You’re ready to go! Remember to make small, incremental, and descriptive commits along the way.

## Extra credits

- Persist your messages in-memory so that they're not erased when the server restarts. Create a `data.json` file on disk, where you dump and persist all those in-memory messages every five seconds. [Config Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#config-files) so that it ignores changes to this file (to avoid continuous reloading), and use [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to exclude the file from your respository (you don’t want the messages data to be part of the app code).

- In the backend, create UPDATE and DELETE routes for editing and deleting messages.

- In the frontend, implement the appropriate user interface (UI) elements to allow users to use these features. These could include buttons or forms for initiating the update or delete action, as well as appropriate confirmation or notification messages.
